Utilities for exploring and transforming the public dataset about
the railroad network of DB Netz, using BaseX (http://www.basex.org)

The data itself can be obtained from
https://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset/data-streckennetz
and must be imported into a BaseX database called "dev" for the
XQuery scripts to work. Indexes should by all means be created,
especially attribute, path, and token index.
